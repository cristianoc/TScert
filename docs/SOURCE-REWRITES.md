# Source rewrites

Changes made to TScert's own TypeScript so that it verifies, each with the
property of the original code that TScert cannot establish and the general
rewrite that removes it. Each entry is a small instance of an operation
TScert is meant to support in general: given code it refuses, propose the
rewrite that makes it sound, or show the behaviour the refusal guards
against.

A rewrite here never weakens a check or hides a behaviour: it either states
a type the code already relies on, adds the check a type promised, or makes
an implicit correlation explicit. A change made for a reason other than
soundness (a tool's defect) is listed apart. A rewrite that a fix of the
verifier would make unnecessary is not one: that fix goes to the verifier.

## Rewrites

### A guard that promises more than its body checks

`isRecordList(v): v is Record<string, unknown>[]` returned
`Array.isArray(v)`, and `isList(v): v is unknown[]` promised a writable
array of any elements. TypeScript does not check a guard's promise; TScert
does, and refuses it.

- **Rewrite:** the guard promises what its body establishes:
  `isList(v): v is readonly unknown[]`, and a reader checks each element
  where it reads it. A first rewrite, `Array.isArray(v) && v.every(isObject)`,
  was still unsound: `every` skips holes, so `new Array(1)` passed with an
  `undefined` element.
- **Pattern:** a type predicate's promise is narrowed to the body's tests,
  or the body gains the tests the promise needs, element by element where
  the promise is about elements.
- **Commits:** 4db5021, 54aa29f (`tools/claim-text.mts`, `tools/diagnostic-view.mts`).

### A dictionary guard over `unknown`

The readers of claims, type graphs and diagnostics took `unknown` and used
`typeof v === "object" && v !== null` as a guard for a dictionary. For an
arbitrary value that test admits class instances and host objects, so the
dictionary promise cannot be established, and every helper built on it was
refused.

- **Rewrite:** the readers take `JsonValue` (`null | boolean | number |
  string | readonly JsonValue[] | { readonly [key: string]: JsonValue }`),
  the type of what they actually read, over which the same tests decide
  the arms.
- **Pattern:** a value read as data is typed by the data's grammar at the
  boundary where it enters (`JSON.parse`, a decoder), not as `unknown`
  inspected by structural tests.
- **Commit:** 795f331 (`tools/calculus.mts`, `claim-text.mts`, `claim.mts`,
  `type-graph.mts`, `diagnostic-view.mts`).

### An annotation weaker than the value the code relies on

`bigintValue` took `unknown` and read a field after an `in` test on an open
object, which no rule admits; `readExplanations` read `JSON.parse`'s result
as `unknown` the same way.

- **Rewrite:** state the type the producer of the value guarantees: the
  synchronous API's bigint literal value (kept `unknown` where the API may
  leave it absent, and spelled only when it is a bigint), and `JSON.parse`'s
  result at a declared JSON type.
- **Pattern:** replace a test-and-read on an open object by the declared type
  of the value's source, where that source's contract states it.
- **Commits:** 2288e06, c76d588 (`tools/computed-types.mts`,
  `pipeline/verify-source.mts`).

### A function called through a field whose annotation states no effect

A method of the gate held as a field (`Gate.abrupt: typeof
statements.abrupt`) and called in a `findIndex` callback, `list.findIndex((s)
=> gate.abrupt(s))`, is read at the field's contract, its annotation, an
ordinary arrow, which states no effect
([calls through a location](SOURCE-ELABORATION.md#inferred-call-effects-elaboration-and-certification)).
A `Gate` whose `abrupt` shrinks the list through another reference is a
value of the type, so the callback is `findIndex`'s unrestricted one, its
element `Statement | undefined`. Only the module function the field is
initialised with keeps the list, and no annotation states that the field
holds it.

- **Rewrite:** a function that reads nothing of the gate is a module
  function recursing through its own binding, `abrupt(s: Statement):
  boolean`, called as `abrupt(s)`; `Gate` holds no field for it. Its effect
  is certified from its body.
- **Pattern:** a function that needs nothing of the object it is reached
  through is called by its binding, whose certified signature a call reads.
- **Commit:** ec3d161 (`tools/fragment-statements.mts`,
  `tools/fragment-parse.mts`).

### A key tested with `in` on an open record

The gate's answers for a node (`staticType`, `contextualParam`,
`assignTypes`, `computedType`, `blockType`, `completion`, `symbolName` of
`tools/declaration-graph.mts`) were each a result or `{ refused: string }`,
read with `if (inferred && "refused" in inferred) gate.fail(node,
inferred.refused)`. After the test the result arm stays possible: an open
record may own `refused` at any type, so reading `inferred.refused` as a
string is refused on principle (`invalid-in-open`,
`invalid-in-open-closure`).

- **Rewrite:** every answer is one shape, `Answered<T>`, `{ ok: true; value:
  T } | { ok: false; refused: string }`, produced and read by its `ok` tag.
- **Pattern:** an `in` test that stands for a tag becomes a tag.
- **Commit:** a3755f0 (`tools/declaration-graph.mts`,
  `fragment-parse.mts`, `fragment-expressions.mts`, `fragment-classes.mts`).

### An index read whose range a check elsewhere establishes

`Object.assign`'s callable form read `const initial = node.arguments[1]` and
tested `ts.isObjectLiteralExpression(initial)`
(`tools/fragment-expressions.mts`), after `callableAssign`
(`fragment-support.mts`) had tested `node.arguments.length === 2` and the
two arguments. TypeScript types an index read at the element type; at run
time a read past the end gives `undefined`, so TScert reads it at
`Expression | undefined`. A compiler-API guard's promise holds on its
domain, the family's nodes ([the domain obligation](HOST-FAMILIES.md#calls)),
so the guard narrowed nothing for an argument that may be `undefined`, and
the read `initial.properties` after it was refused ("missing field
properties"). The length test that makes the read in range was in another
function, an implicit correlation.

- **Rewrite:** the check returns what it establishes: `callableAssign`
  returns the call, the arrow and the object literal it tested, or null,
  testing each argument against `undefined` before its guard, and its
  callers read those.
- **Pattern:** a value whose presence another function checks becomes that
  function's result.
- **Commit:** 87afc37 (`tools/fragment-support.mts`,
  `fragment-parse.mts`, `fragment-expressions.mts`).

### A rest parameter's reading tested with `in`

`restPositions` (`tools/type-term.mts`) read a rest parameter's type as
`{ positions: TypeTerm[] } | { element: TypeTerm }`, and `signatures` and
the declaration graph's signatures told the arms apart with
`"positions" in contract`. After the test the `element` arm stays
possible, since an open record may own `positions` at any type, so reading
`contract.positions` was refused on principle ("missing field
positions").

- **Rewrite:** each arm carries `k`, `{ k: "positions"; positions }` or
  `{ k: "element"; element }` (`RestPositions`), produced and read by `k`.
- **Pattern:** an `in` test that stands for a tag becomes a tag.
- **Commit:** this entry's commit (`tools/type-term.mts`,
  `declaration-graph.mts`).

### A cache in an optional field of a shared object

`Gate.resolve` (`tools/fragment-expressions.mts`) built the file's bindings
on its first call and stored them with `gate.bindings = bindings`, the field
declared `bindings?: Map<Node, Map<string, Node>>`. A value of type `Gate`
may lack an optional key, so the write may add a key to the object, which
the gate's other holders see; the calculus types a key-adding write only as
the copy of a local's own fresh object
([key-adding writes](PROGRAM-TYPING.md#key-adding-writes)), so the write is
refused on principle (`optional-write-refused`).

- **Rewrite:** the field is always owned, `bindings: Map<Node, Map<string,
  Node>> | null = null`, and `resolve` reads it into a local, building and
  storing the table where it is `null`.
- **Pattern:** a field written after construction is declared with an
  initializer and a type that holds its absent state (`T | null`), so a
  write replaces its value and adds no key.
- **Commit:** this entry's commit (`tools/fragment-parse.mts`,
  `fragment-expressions.mts`).

### A `map` callback calling a method of a structurally typed object

`protocolPattern` (`tools/fragment-statements.mts`) built its bindings as
`const bindings: BindingAst[] = named.map(({ cell, name }) => ({ …, name:
gate.local(name), namePos: gate.span(name), … }))`, and its `let` cells by a
`map` callback calling `site.span()`. A method reached through a value of a
class's or an object type is read at its signature, which states no effect:
any value of the type may hold a method that changes any storage. So each
callback is unrestricted, `map` takes its signature with holes
([natives](FOOTPRINTS.md#natives)), and its result is no `BindingAst[]`
(`invalid-map-method-call-effect`, run under Node: a `Names` whose `local`
pops the mapped array leaves a hole). The array mapped here is local and
reaches no such method, which only separating storage an unknown call cannot
reach would show ([deferred precision](FOOTPRINTS.md#deferred-extra-precision)).

- **Rewrite:** each array is built by a `for...of` loop pushing onto a fresh
  `BindingAst[]`, calling the methods in the same order; `push` keeps the
  array dense whatever the calls do (`map-method-loop-push`).
- **Pattern:** an array whose elements need calls of unbounded effect is
  collected by a loop pushing them, rather than by a `map` callback.
- **Commit:** this entry's commit (`tools/fragment-statements.mts`).

## Rewrites required, not made

A source pattern of TScert's own code that TScert refuses on principle is
listed here, with the rewrite that removes it, until the rewrite is made.

## Changes for a tool's defect

### The compiler API's empty-tuple panic

TypeScript 7.0.2's API panics writing a union that holds an empty array
literal's tuple type (fixed upstream in 7.1). `forInEntryReads` destructured
`ts.isVariableStatement(s) ? s.declarationList.declarations : []`, so every
slice including it ended in that tool failure.

- **Change:** read the first declaration by index, forming no empty tuple.
- **Commit:** f704fdb (`tools/fragment-support.mts`).
