# Verification work

This is the work ledger for the independent verifier: open work, the reason
each item is open and when it closes. [DESIGN](docs/DESIGN.md) states the
architecture and decisions; [the source boundary](docs/SOURCE-FRAGMENT.md) owns
supported-fragment restrictions.

## Next steps

### Open work

<a id="a-connection-to-ecma-262"></a>
**A connection to ECMA-262.** Proving the host's stated types as lemmas of a
mechanized specification would turn the ECMA rows of the trust surface into
theorems; the lemmas and their cost are in
[TRUST-REDUCTION](docs/TRUST-REDUCTION.md#the-host).

<a id="constructor-rests"></a>
**Constructor rests.** A constructor's rest parameter is refused: `new`
constructs only code without a rest (`CallArguments.construction`), so code
collecting one needs a construction that allocates the rest store from the
actuals past its parameters, and an introduction of a variadic construct
signature from such code, as `restsT_of_graphRest` is for a function.

<a id="class-offers-across-units"></a>
**Class offers across units.** A class value is offered a signature its use
expects (a variadic construct signature, a longer one) where its binding
and the use are analysed together: at the module's statements. A module
function passing a module class to a variadic construct signature leaves the
class's claim without that signature, and the call is a search failure; the
offer needs the class claim to collect the signatures every unit's uses
expect.

<a id="generic-methods-left"></a>
**Generic methods left.** A class's generic method with a bounded binder:
the member's binder row is named by its bound, which the parser does not
spell for the closure (`class-generic-method-bounded-refused`). Members of
two declarations, or of two instances of one, binding as many binders relate
up to renaming ([generic methods](docs/SOURCE-CONTRACTS.md#generic-methods)); two
binding different numbers of binders (`m<U, V>` at `m<W>`), which TypeScript
relates by instantiating the source at the target's binders, need an instance
table naming each source signature's image at the target's binders, inside
the family entry's table. A binder a member's result accumulates
(`catch`'s `Promise<T | TResult>`) grows its family by one binder per call:
each is an application of the one equation, unfolded only when read
([RECURSIVE-EQUATIONS](docs/RECURSIVE-EQUATIONS.md)), never truncated.

<a id="restoring-completeness"></a>
**Contract completeness.** Array presence, callback effects and conversion
contracts impose separate obligations. Their current designs are stated under
[arrays](docs/SOURCE-MODEL.md#arrays), [native contracts](docs/SOURCE-MODEL.md#exact-contracts-and-native-effects) and
[effect certification](docs/SOURCE-MODEL.md#inferred-call-effects-elaboration-and-certification).
A future inference improvement must preserve these distinctions: density is
stronger than readable elements; readonly aliases do not prevent callback
mutation; and a written callback annotation cannot silently acquire a stronger
effect. A program with an arbitrary callback promising readable `U[]` for every
`U` must justify that promise even when the callback shrinks the source.

Effect inference remains conservative for some rest wrappers, call forms and
nested heap operations. Expression scheduling alone does not supply the missing
effect derivation. Code that writes only locations it allocated preserves the
heap it was called with, but a body's checked footprint does not separate
those from older ones ([footprint precision](#footprints)). A call of a value holding a fixed
signature and its variadic extension, a module constant read as a value
elsewhere, is not certified preserving: the selected call's evidence is no
qualified application at the fixed signature. Keep the source targets and their
negative controls when extending the body-effect checker.

<a id="footprints"></a>
**Footprints.** [FOOTPRINTS](docs/FOOTPRINTS.md) states the mechanism: a
construct's fact, the operations proved to keep it, stated as closed
footprints, and Lean's node-by-node check that a callback, with what it
calls, stays within one. The checked forms are inspections, typed writes of
fields holding values, and fixed calls, variadic calls without spreads and
constructions at a selected signature. Left open:

- the other application forms (a variadic construction, a call of a
  callable object, a packed call) consume no footprint, so a bounded body
  refuses them;
- an array element write has no bound; the fragment writes elements only at
  proved index singletons, and no measured program needs one.

**Footprint precision** is deferred
([FOOTPRINTS](docs/FOOTPRINTS.md#deferred-extra-precision)): separating one
array from another, so that `pop` on an array the callback allocated is
admitted.

<a id="keys-known-only-at-run-time"></a>
**Keys known only at run time.** A write at a string key known only at run
time of an object or `null` value needs the copy to replace the prototype
where the key is `__proto__`, as the setter does; a key-adding write at a key
that may be a string or a symbol, a dispatch on the key's kind. A write adding
a key to an object a reference other than its holding locals may hold (a
callee, a closure, a `let` bound to it) needs the heap to map an object's
identity to its keys, which it does not. A key added to a class instance
whose prototype holds methods is copied with the prototype, but the copy is
typed as the record `mergeResult` gives, which states no method: it needs a
merge result at the instance's row.

<a id="module-composition"></a>
**Module composition** as a Lean theorem: the step-indexed argument that
units certified against each other's signatures compose.

<a id="iteration-left-open"></a>
**Iteration left open.** An array pattern over a host
non-array iterable needs the pattern's reads as steps of `%Iterate:K%`, or of
the protocol. A spread of a program's iterable where the statement evaluates
code before it, and a default or nested pattern in an array pattern over one,
need the protocol's steps interleaved with that code, in the expression, not
before the statement. A generator needs a state-machine lowering, as
TypeScript's downlevel emit writes one: a closure over the suspension
point's number and the live locals, whose `next` resumes at a `switch` on
it. An element read past a readonly tuple arm's length needs a rule
reading `undefined` beyond an exact length.

<a id="remaining-source-forms"></a>
**Remaining source forms.** A method call on a union of primitives,
which needs one callee contract its receiver meets. A source binder used both
as a pack and as an array value (`...args: T`, `args: T`): a binder whose instances are
arrays or tuples of required positions, its pack meaning that tuple contract's lists, so an
entry collects the fresh store at it and a spread of its value gives a list in the pack. Explicit type arguments on an element call,
which reach an element only as a generic closure's quantified claim.
User guards and assertion functions: the promise is a contract a
conjunction of arrows states, `(x: A) => boolean` with
`(x: Exclude<A, T>) => false` (an assertion function's `=> never`), which the
body is checked at, as a closure at each of its signatures; a caller narrows
through a fact the call leaves tying its result slot to its argument slot,
"an argument in `Exclude<A, T>` gave `false`", which the branch on the
result turns into a slice of the argument. Such a fact is about a type's
meaning, world- and level-indexed, where current-content facts are not; it
needs its own place in the knowledge a statement entry states. A static
initializer calling a static method reading its class, or constructing it
where construction reads an earlier static field, which runs the class's code
before the class value exists (a construction reading a later one reads
`undefined`, refused on principle); private
names in inheritance, which needs the derived construction's copy of its
base part to carry the base's private slots; a prototype member keyed by a
symbol.

<a id="model-limits-of-one-form-each"></a>
**Model limits of one form each.** Module storage (`declare let`, a
module-level `let`) needs cells every call may write, read at their declared
type. Sloppy code's `this` at a receiver type that may hold a primitive,
`undefined` or `null` needs the receiver conversion (the global object, a
wrapper). A library class as a base needs a construction rule for what its
constructor allocates. `keyof T` and `T[K]` over a function's own binder need a row whose
meaning fixes a key set, which a value set does not. `o.m?.()` needs the receiver saved
across the test. `key in o` at a key the built-in prototypes hold needs those
prototypes' keys in the model.

<a id="precision"></a>
**Precision.** Retaining heap facts across calls needs a proved
reachability or noninterference statement: the model's types do not bound
the locations a value names (`top` admits any object), so a location
allocated after a value cannot be shown unnamed by it, and the statement
needs every type's meaning to bound its value's locations by the world; set-valued clause covering (an
arrow against a union of arrows) needs a covering relation of another arity;
a vacuity escape for contradictory reference conjunctions
(`Ref null ∧ Ref bool ≤ Ref (null ∨ bool)`) is true and not derivable; the
producer's arrow search builds no nested `combine`. An element read keeps no
heap fact: it reads the heap only, but the value it finds is a value only
where the store's contract says so, which the frame rule would have to take
from the read's typing (a length is a number, and keeps them). An element
read the code guards is read at the element type or `undefined`
(`guarded-element-read-refused`): `out[out.length - 1]` under a nonzero
length needs the index and the length related by arithmetic the typing does
not decide, and `xs[0] !== undefined && known.has(xs[0])` needs a
current-content fact about an element location, kept from the test to the
second read, as a field path would need one (`o.a !== undefined &&
f(o.a)` is refused the same way). A `flatMap` callback returning a
primitive or an array of primitives (`flat-map-scalar-result-refused`)
needs a second signature quantifying a binder bounded by the primitives,
which the first does not use: neither the producer's instance of a member
read nor Lean's search for one assigns a binder no parameter of the
selected signature names. The design question is per-signature binders, or
bounds, in a prototype member's scheme.

<a id="a-semantics-of-the-fragment"></a>
**A semantics of the Fragment.** The parser's rewrites and extraction rest
on review. The Fragment moves close to source JavaScript, the rewrites move
into extraction, and the Fragment gets a direct semantics in Lean: an
executable interpreter that reads it as JavaScript does, with types erased.
Extraction is proved a simulation of it. The interpreter's faithfulness to
JavaScript is tested against node, not proved: the target is fixed, so
testing converges without a mechanized specification. A rewrite chosen by a
type (`%Iterate:K%`, `%ElementAt%`) is correct under that typing premise.
The reading of declared types and the host remain trusted; the remaining
options are in [TRUST-REDUCTION](docs/TRUST-REDUCTION.md).

<a id="computed-types-evaluated-through-helper-declarations"></a>
**Computed types evaluated through helper declarations.** A computed form
naming a declaration's parameters (a bound, a default, an annotation's
computed alias) is evaluated at an application by the pinned TypeScript,
through helper declarations added to a probe program
([written applications](docs/SOURCE-CONTRACTS.md#written-applications),
`tools/type-probe.mts`): the checker offers no operation instantiating a
declaration's syntax. This is a stopgap, to be either relaxed or checked.
Relaxed: where TypeScript's API offers a direct checker endpoint for
instantiation and `keyof` (a declaration, its arguments, a parameter's
instantiated bound or default), it replaces the helper declarations and
their resolution checks. Checked: a source-type elaborator whose reductions
Lean checks, from declaration-linked bounds and completed arguments to the
semantic types, so that the correspondence to TypeScript's computation is
proved rather than trusted. Either retires the clause of the trust surface's
TypeScript row stating that "a computed form naming a declaration's
parameters, at an application, means what the checker computes for a probe
declaration" ([trust surface](docs/DESIGN.md#trust-surface)); the checked
form retires the computation's trust altogether, the relaxed one only the
probe's correspondence to the application.

<a id="the-front-ends-own-functions"></a>
**The front end's own functions.** Each top-level function of `tools/*.mts`,
sliced into its own file with the same-file declarations it uses, is a piece
of ordinary TypeScript the pipeline can be asked about: 266 of them. A slice
stops at its first refusal, so each blocker below hides the ones behind it.
The first blockers, by the number of slices each stops (2026-10-16):

- a namespace import, `import * as ts` (126);
- a missing annotation, or a value TypeScript types `any` (35);
- the compiler API's own declarations, `SyntaxKind`, `TypeFlags`,
  `NodeFlags`, `SymbolFlags` (13);
- library globals absent from the overlay or refused: the global function
  `parseInt` (3), `Reflect` (2, [refused](docs/SOURCE-FRAGMENT.md)),
  `Array.from`, `Object.fromEntries`, `new RegExp` (1 each);
- a type reference to the parser's `EnumMember` (5), module-level `let` and
  `var` (5), a mapped type whose value names its key (3).

Seven slices reach the producer and fail there, and twenty-two fail in
search. Of the 23 functions of `dev/`, the record tools and the lowering
dump, 14 verify, and of the 13 of `tests/`, 4 (2026-10-17, each sliced with
the same-file declarations it uses). The first blockers of the others in
`dev/`, with the functions each stops directly and through callees:

- `shift` of an array a `map` callback allocated (effects: `rest.shift()` on
  the result of `parts`), which the rule refuses
  ([footprint precision](#footprints)) (effects; through it section, card,
  pageBody: 4);
- a `map` callback running a child process, whose effect no contract bounds
  (group: 1);
- an element read a length guards (`paragraphs[paragraphs.length - 1]`,
  `guarded-element-read-refused`; parseTrailers, parseRecord: 2);
- a conditional type over a type parameter, `KeysOf<T>` (printGraph,
  showStep: 2).

In `tests/`, `docs.mts`'s `withoutCode`, `prose`, `slug` and `compare`
verify; the others stop at a namespace import, Node's `Buffer` type, `join`
of `node:path`, `Number` read as a value, or a top-level block.

Two forms of the record tools are rewritten for a verifier limit, not
for a departure from the fragment; each rewrite is reverted when its limit
lifts: element reads the code already guards, by a length or a test of the
same element (`dedent`, `effects`, `mathRoles`' `afterRelation` and
`textWord`; `guarded-element-read-refused`); and a `flatMap` callback
returning a string (`card`; `flat-map-scalar-result-refused`).

The goal is every function of the repository's own TypeScript verified:
`tools/`, `pipeline/`, `tests/` and `dev/`, about 21,000 lines (the sources
under `pipeline/examples/` are the cases' inputs, many refused by design).
Verification states safety, each function's annotated contract at every
call, not that the parser reads TypeScript correctly. A scan of that code
against the fragment (2026-10-16) gives the work, each item its own design:

- **The compiler API.** About 120 functions read TypeScript's syntax tree
  through `typescript/unstable/ast` and its checker through
  `typescript/unstable/sync`; [the compiler API](docs/COMPILER-API.md)
  specifies the contract they are verified under. Its implementation waits
  on immutable fields and foreign arrays in the calculus, a compact
  representation of kind sets in claims and evidence, and guard signatures
  for the sync API's type guards.
- **Guard signatures.** A guard's promise is part of its function type,
  proved at its definition and consumed at a call, for any promised type
  and across modules.
- **Bounds of every alias application.** An alias with a bounded parameter
  keeps the obligation that its arguments meet their bounds, whatever its
  body.
- <a id="regular-expressions-left"></a>**Regular expressions left.** A
  literal, `exec`, `test` and the string methods dispatching to a regex are
  admitted ([regular expressions](docs/SOURCE-CONTRACTS.md#regular-expressions)).
  Left: a replacement callback, whose argument list follows the shape
  (`(match, p₁ … pₙ, offset, input[, groups])`, every match collected before
  the first call, its result a string); `new RegExp(p, f)` of strings, a
  native regex of the conservative shape; a regex's properties, `lastIndex`
  (own, not enumerable, a number) and the accessors `source` and `flags`,
  read through reserved host-relative members so that no record view states
  them, with `in`, patterns and computed reads of their keys accounted for;
  a loop over a structural iterator TypeScript types `RegExpStringIterator`,
  through the iterator protocol; and the same native mark on `SetIterator`
  and `MapIterator`, whose loops are chosen by TypeScript's type alone.
- **The library globals left.** `Array.prototype.flatMap` (79 calls) and
  `flat`, `String.prototype.match`, `matchAll`, `padEnd`, `padStart` and
  `search`, `Object.fromEntries`, `hasOwn` and `assign`, `Array.from`,
  `Math` but `max` and `min`, `parseInt`, and `JSON.stringify` of an
  object, whose `toJSON` runs client code.
- **Node's modules.** `node:fs`, `path`, `child_process` (`spawnSync`,
  `execFileSync`, `fork` and its messages), `os`, `crypto`, `vm`, `net`,
  `module`, `assert/strict` (assertion functions) and `process`.
- **Classes and `this` parameters.** The parser's `Gate` class, the functions
  of `fragment-*.mts` declaring `this: Gate` (198 reads of `this`), and the
  error classes extending `Error`.
- **Imports between the repository's modules.** Namespace and default
  imports, and a value imported from another module certified against its
  signature, which [module composition](#module-composition) proves sound.
- **The code's own departures from the fragment.** Downcasting `as`
  assertions and module-level `let`: the code changes to meet the fragment.
- **Proof precision.** Of the slices past the gate, about half fail in
  proposal or search; each failure is a separate investigation.
